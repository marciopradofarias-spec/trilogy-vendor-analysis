# EXECUTIVE MEMORANDUM

**TO:** CEO & CFO  
**FROM:** VP of Operations  
**DATE:** February 3, 2026  
**RE:** Vendor Spend Analysis - Acquisition Integration Savings Plan

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of the acquired company's $7.9M vendor portfolio identifies **$843K in immediate annual savings (10.7% reduction)** through three strategic initiatives. These opportunities stem from vendor fragmentation across geographies and redundant technology investments that can be rationalized post-acquisition.

## Top 3 Savings Opportunities

### 1. Salesforce License Optimization — $468K Annual Savings
**Current State:** $3.1M annual spend represents 40% of total vendor costs  
**Action:** Renegotiate enterprise agreement, eliminate 80+ inactive users, optimize license types  
**Timeline:** 60 days  
**Risk:** Low - standard post-M&A activity expected by Salesforce

**Rationale:** Current deployment shows signs of over-licensing typical in rapid-growth companies. Our licensing audit tool identified significant optimization potential while maintaining full functionality for active sales teams.

### 2. Global Office Consolidation — $306K Annual Savings  
**Current State:** 27 office locations across 8 countries ($1.5M annual)  
**Action:** Exit 8 under-utilized leases, consolidate to regional hubs with flex workspace  
**Timeline:** 6 months (lease expiration dependent)  
**Risk:** Medium - requires HR coordination for remote work policies

**Rationale:** Overlapping footprint from acquisition creates immediate consolidation opportunity. Croatia has 4 separate office leases within 10km radius. Post-COVID workplace flexibility enables 25% footprint reduction without productivity impact.

### 3. SaaS Tool Rationalization — $69K Annual Savings
**Current State:** 14 SaaS tools including redundant PSA, accounting, and planning platforms  
**Action:** Migrate Kimble/Planful functionality to Salesforce, consolidate accounting to single platform  
**Timeline:** 90 days  
**Risk:** Low - target tools have native Salesforce alternatives

**Rationale:** Tool sprawl creates integration overhead and duplicate data entry. Native Salesforce capabilities can replace 40% of external tools while improving data quality.

## Additional Findings

**Vendor Fragmentation:** 170 vendors (44%) flagged for consolidation across recruitment (12 agencies), insurance (8 providers), and M&A advisory (4 firms). Secondary phase targeting $200K+ additional savings.

**Quick Wins:** 159 vendors ($180K) identified for immediate termination - student housing, inactive subscriptions, and legacy contractors no longer required post-integration.

## Recommended Action Plan

**Week 1-2:** Initiate Salesforce licensing audit and contract review  
**Week 3-4:** Begin office utilization analysis and lease termination planning  
**Week 5-8:** Execute SaaS migration plan with IT team  
**Month 3:** Negotiate consolidated vendor contracts (recruitment, insurance)  
**Month 6:** Complete office consolidation and report final savings

## Financial Impact

| Initiative | Annual Savings | Implementation Cost | Net Year 1 |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Salesforce Optimization | $468K | $25K | $443K |
| Office Consolidation | $306K | $45K | $261K |
| SaaS Rationalization | $69K | $15K | $54K |
| **Total** | **$843K** | **$85K** | **$758K** |

**ROI:** 8.9x in Year 1, with full $843K recurring savings in subsequent years

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Vendor Lock-in Penalties:** Budget $35K for early termination fees (office leases)
- **Business Continuity:** Phased migration approach ensures zero downtime
- **Stakeholder Resistance:** Facilities consolidation requires change management and remote work policy alignment

## Next Steps

Request approval to proceed with Salesforce audit and initiate vendor contract reviews. Detailed implementation playbooks ready for immediate deployment upon authorization.
